# student-score-ml-regression
Learning journey on regression models with EDA, feature engineering, and agent integration.

ðŸ”Ž Overview

This project is my learning journey in Machine Learning, focusing on regression tasks.
I use the student_scores.csv dataset to predict students' exam scores based on their study hours.

The workflow is divided into multiple steps (separate notebooks), so the progress can be tracked clearly.
